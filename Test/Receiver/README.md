# Test-Sketch Receiver
This sketch is meant to be run on a Wemos D1-Mini. It publishes the received data to the corresponding MQTT Topics.
Note that, despite the fact it works, this sketch has only been written for test purposes. I strongly recommend using
the Object-Oriented approach used in my [Sensor-Module Repository](https://github.com/JVKran/Sensor-Module).
