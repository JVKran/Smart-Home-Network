# Smart-Home-Network
After years of using Home Assistant with power hungry ESP's and the desire to create battery powered sensor modules, I started creating a universal wireless network optimized for battery powered devices.

## Research
I've done quite a lot of research to determine the best protocol to use. This can be found in the Documentation folder. 

## Status
Right now, it's possible to let an ATtiny85 with STX822, CR2032 and AM312 Home Assistant know when there's movement. However, since I want to also be able to publish temperature, humidity and pressure, there won't be any major release soon.
